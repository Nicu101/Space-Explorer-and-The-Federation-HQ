# Space-Explorer-and-The-Federation-HQ

# Objectives:

   Let there be a galaxy with space explorers and Federation headquarters (HQs). The goal of the
space explorers is to explore all the wormholes so that they have a complete view of the galaxy. The
wormholes connect two star systems together, but entering them requires a perfect decoding of their
sub-space-mambo-jumbonian frequencies. Once a wormhole is explored, the federation sends a special sci-
ence vessel through, which, if it survives, scans the new solar system and provides the data about the next
wormholes and the star systems they connect.
  The Federation has multiple HQs, but they can be busy with other tasks and, as such, they are not al-
ways available. When a Federation HQ is available, it takes the decoded solution from the space explorers
and sends the science vessel. If the decoding is wrong when the science vessel tries to enter the worm-hole,
a great explosion destroys the galaxy, kills everyone, ends the program.

# Space Explorers and the Sub-space-mambo-jumbonian Frequencies:

  Each frequency decoding starts with data from the federation HQ, on which the science vessel uses an ana-
lyzatron and computes the frequency as a seemingly random string. The space explorer then needs to decode
the sub-space-mambo-jumbonian frequencies, in order to enter a wormhole. To do this, the space explorer
needs to compute the hash of the hash of the hash of ... of the hash of the frequency 1 . The number of times
to repeat the hash operation is fixed and given as a parameter to the simulation.
  The space explorers start the simulation at a given set of star systems which can be reached with bor-
ing slower-than-the-speed-of-light drives. Then, they get the list of wormholes from the federation HQs.
Each wormhole has a frequency represented as a string sequence attached to it. An explorer chooses a
wormhole and explores it by decoding the frequency and then sending the result to the Federation HQs,
which verify its correctness by sending the science vessel.
